# SSL Scripting Language

SSL (Star Trek Scripting Language) is the scripting language used in Fallout 2 for game logic, dialogue, and world interactions.

## What is SSL?

SSL scripts control virtually every interactive aspect of the game:

- NPC behavior and AI
- Dialogue trees and reactions
- Item usage effects
- Map triggers and events
- Quest logic
- Combat modifiers

Scripts are written in `.ssl` files, compiled to `.int` (interpreted) bytecode, and executed by the game engine.

## Script Types

| Type | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| Object Scripts | Attached to specific objects/NPCs | `scripts/` |
| Map Scripts | Run when entering/leaving maps | `scripts/` |
| Global Scripts | Always running | `scripts/` |
| Spatial Scripts | Triggered by tile proximity | `scripts/` |

## Basic Structure

Every SSL script follows this structure:

```ssl
/* Script header with includes */
#include "define.h"
#include "command.h"

/* Variable declarations */
variable my_var;

/* Procedures */
procedure start;
procedure talk_p_proc;

procedure start begin
    // Script initialization
end

procedure talk_p_proc begin
    // Called when player talks to this object
end
```

## Event Procedures

The engine calls specific procedures in response to game events:

| Procedure | When Called |
|-----------|-------------|
| `start` | Script initialization |
| `map_enter_p_proc` | Player enters map |
| `map_exit_p_proc` | Player exits map |
| `map_update_p_proc` | Periodic map update |
| `talk_p_proc` | Player initiates dialogue |
| `look_at_p_proc` | Player examines object |
| `description_p_proc` | Detailed examination |
| `use_p_proc` | Player uses object |
| `use_obj_on_p_proc` | Item used on object |
| `use_skill_on_p_proc` | Skill used on object |
| `damage_p_proc` | Object takes damage |
| `destroy_p_proc` | Object destroyed |
| `critter_p_proc` | Critter AI update |
| `pickup_p_proc` | Item picked up |
| `drop_p_proc` | Item dropped |
| `combat_p_proc` | Combat round |
| `timed_event_p_proc` | Timed event fires |
| `spatial_p_proc` | Spatial trigger activated |

## Compilation

SSL source files are compiled using [sslc](https://github.com/sfall-team/sslc) (Star-Trek Scripting Language Compiler):

```bash
sslc -o myscript.int myscript.ssl
```

The resulting `.int` file contains bytecode that the engine's interpreter executes.

### Decompilation

To decompile `.int` files back to SSL source, use [int2ssl](https://github.com/falltergeist/int2ssl):

```bash
int2ssl myscript.int
```

## Getting Started

1. Read the [Syntax Guide](/ssl/syntax) to learn the language
2. Check the [Standard Library](/ssl/stdlib) for available functions
3. Try the [Basic Examples](/ssl/examples/basic)

## Extending with sfall

[sfall](https://github.com/sfall-team/sfall) extends SSL with additional opcodes and features:

- New scripting functions
- Hook scripts for engine events
- Global scripts with custom timing
- Extended array support
- And much more
