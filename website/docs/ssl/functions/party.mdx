# Party Functions

Functions for managing party members and companions.

## party_add <span class="tag-vanilla">vanilla</span> {#party_add}

```ssl
void party_add(ObjectPtr who)
```

Adds a given critter into the list of party members. This will also setup those objects so that they will not be saved in maps, and certain other things.

**Parameters:**
- `who` - Critter to add to party

**Example:**
```ssl
procedure hire_npc begin
    party_add(self_obj);
    float_msg(self_obj, "I'll travel with you!", FLOAT_MSG_NORMAL);
end
```


<FnRef fn="party_add" />

## party_remove <span class="tag-vanilla">vanilla</span> {#party_remove}

```ssl
void party_remove(ObjectPtr who)
```

Removes a given critter from the list of party members. This will also change those objects so that certain object- and map-level things will respond differently to them.

**Parameters:**
- `who` - Critter to remove from party


<FnRef fn="party_remove" />

## party_member_obj <span class="tag-vanilla">vanilla</span> {#party_member_obj}

```ssl
ObjectPtr party_member_obj(int pid)
```

Returns an ObjectPtr to a party member that matches a given prototype ID. If that critter isn't currently a member of the party, returns NULL.

**Parameters:**
- `pid` - Prototype ID to search for

**Returns:** `ObjectPtr` - Party member or NULL

**Example:**
```ssl
variable sulik;
sulik := party_member_obj(PID_SULIK);
if (sulik) then begin
    display_msg("Sulik is in your party.");
end else begin
    display_msg("Sulik is not with you.");
end
```

## party_member_count <span class="tag-vanilla">vanilla</span> {#party_member_count}

```ssl
int party_member_count(int countHidden)
```

Returns the count of currently in-party party members.

**Parameters:**
- `countHidden` - Whether to count hidden members (hangers-on): 0 = no, 1 = yes

**Returns:** `int` - Party member count

**Example:**
```ssl
variable count;
count := party_member_count(0);
display_msg("You have " + count + " companions.");
```
